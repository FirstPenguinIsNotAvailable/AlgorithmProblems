# Algorithm

> ## What is purpose?
> `Purpose` is studying a lot of algorithm problems in terms of dynamic programming, graph, tree etc. indeed, I wish this PS would be a good practice to get a job at the **largest tech companies** as well as becoming a better engineer than any others

> ## How to study?
> ### how to place a folder or file?
> you should place the folder or file you create on the right page. 
> 1. The start page is any sites of algorithm problems. for example, it can be Leetcode, Baekjoon and Kickstart. also, it must be a folder
> 2. The middle page between the start and the last page is the paths of a problem you chose. it also must be a folder. for example, if there is a problem called 'a1' which of paths is "Alphabets/~/a1", this page is supposed to be ~ part
> 3. The last page is about who you are. so its name must be your name. for example, it should be "Steven" in my case. besides, it's supposed to include your code and **five steps** files. therefore, it must be a folder as well. (**five steps** is explained below) 
>
>  ### how to review each other?
>  It basically uses the concepts of commit and searching a history log etc. so you should know how to use git at least. here is a link for those who don't know git [git document](https://git-scm.com/book/ko/v2/%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0-%EB%B2%84%EC%A0%84-%EA%B4%80%EB%A6%AC%EB%9E%80?) (it's a korean version)
> 
>  **Here is steps for reviewer**  
>  1. you pick up anyone you want to review on the third page
>  2. after reviewing, please, write the explanation why your approach is better than owner's code in commit message. and you commit it.
> 3. you should let the owner of the file know that you reviewed it by using any chatting apps or calling.
> 
> **Here is steps for a person who received the review**
>  1. you should search history of the file that was reviewed.
>  2. if you like the code that reviewers write, you keep it. if not, return it the old version

> ## Introduction of five steps
> You need to fill out a form called 'Five Steps' and solve the problem at the same time. this form is about the process when you do this.  i attach it on the first page. let me tell you each step in the form. 
> 1. Understand
	=> you summarize the content of the problem and also should include constraints.
>
> 2. Redefine
> => you define the problem as your own language. especially, it must be a kind of mathematical or computational concepts. for example, you can use concepts related to discrete mathematics
>
> 3. Plan
> => you choose a algorithm or structure in this step. and write down how to solve the problem. 
>
> 4. Verify 
> => you verify a strategy you build like analyzing the efficiency of the algorithm you chosen. i recommend you to compare time complexity of the algorithm with the constraint of the problem.
>
> 5. Review
> => you can improve your code by reviewing your approach. for example, if i solve a problem with brute force, then you may say "Oh, i can use dynamic programming here"

> âœ¡ Please, leave the link of your problem below in five steps file.
